# Free Urinals
Since it is Test Driven Development, tests are created first.
1. Tests are created for three functions readingFile, writingFile, and countUrinals.
2. The input is either taken from keyboard or input file(urinal.dat) which contains strings.
3. countUrinals calculates the number of urinals that are free.
4. The calculated count is added to the output file.
5. The output file consists of number of urinals that are free and can be used.
